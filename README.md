## NBA_VIZ

This is a super simple bokeh app designed to interactively vizualize up-to-date statistics for each of the 30 teams. It relies on the nba_py wrapper for the stats.nba.com endpoint.

To run this locally: 
 1. Make sure you have the latest version of bokeh installed
 2. clone this repo
 3. navigate to the directory containing the root folder
 4. Type the following command
```
bokeh serve --show nba_viz
```

Have fun! It's totally incomplete but should provide for at least some fun visual goodness.
